# Senators

I've compiled a list of senators from the 111th-115th (2001-2017) Congresses. They serve/served the terms of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

List of senators in 115th Congress was taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Senators_in_the_115th_Congress_by_seniority (same done for the other Congresses)

(Alternate reference link: https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senators_chronological.htm)

## Go back:

1. `"Hillary Rodham Clinton"` or `"Hillary Clinton"` for `"name"`?

2. Should Independent senators (denoted with `"party": "I"`) be further investigated and determined liberal/conservative? i.e. Bernie Sanders is considered very liberal.

3. I've listed all the senators for the 115th (current) Congress only. Is it necessary to go back even further? Perhaps just the 114th and 115th Congresses? Because the articles I search will come from 2015-2017.
