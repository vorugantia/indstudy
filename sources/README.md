# Sources

For now, I'm just selecting the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal as the two news sources I will query. They are the top two news publications of New York and NYT is supposed to be left-leaning, while WSJ is supposed to be right-leaning.

For now, `source_list.json` is just a simple array of source names.
